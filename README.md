### NBA Fantasy Stat Category League Analysis

A short project analyzing how different stat categories relate to performance in my particular NBA fantasy league

In the project report (Fantasy Analysis.ipynb), I go through how I process and analyze the data

I have created custom Python libraries to query and store data from both ESPN and Yahoo fantasy servers. This isn't touched on in the report, but you can look through all the different python files in the root folder to get a better understanding of how it works.
